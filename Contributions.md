# Contributor Guidelines

We welcome contributions from other developers to help us make the ChatHub even better. Before you contribute there are a number of things that you should know. 

## Test

To execute all tests included into the project connect a device or emulator, then run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

Due to the fact that we're using [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) as code versioning methodology, you as developer should **always** start working on [develop branch](https://github.com/wajahatkarim3/ChatHub/tree/develop) that contains the most recent changes.

1. Create a new issue for the feature
2. Fork the develop branch of the project
3. Create a new branch with feature name or issue fix name
4. Add commits and push the code
5. Open a pull request
6. Submit for code review
7. Once approved, we will merge with develop branch

Every feature should follow this procedure.
